Uhh, it's static HTML. Look at the branch `gh-pages`. Or [browse it directly](https://benwiederhake.github.io/shitlist/)!

## TODOs

Things I should do eventually:
* Make it even nicer?
* Tell people about it
* ???
* Profit!

## NOTDOs

Things I definitely don't wanna do:
* Making an actual forum out of it
* Get sued for trademark infringement on the term "shitlist" (please don't sue me, loadingreadyrun!)
